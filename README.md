I was finally able to track this program down on one of my backups.

This program simulates the way a mine sweeper game would populate
its game map. Nothing serious, just a fun exercise while I was 
learning Python. It's designed to run on a command shell in 
Windows or Linux. 

At some point I will go back through it and modernize the code.
